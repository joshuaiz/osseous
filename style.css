Theme Name: Osseous (Rename Me!)
Theme URI: http://wearebio.com/osseous
Description: This site was built using Osseous, a custom version of the fantastic Bones Development Theme (http://themble.com/bones/). For more information about Bones or to view documentation, you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones/issues" title="Bones Issues">Bones Issues</a> page on Github. This theme is a stripped-down Bones that I developed for use with my development projects but I thought others could use it too. So here it is. Note: you'll want to customize this description for your clients with your own information.

OSSEOUS NOTES
..................................................................

First, if you're not familiar with how Bones works, I highly recommend
developing even a simple practice site with it before using Osseous.
Get your workflow down - figure out how you might use Bones and the best
way to make it your own.

That's exactly what I did to create Osseous. After developing more than
30 sites with Bones, I found myself changing certain default Bones things
over and over again for every site. So, to speed up development even more,
with Osseous I've added my own defaults, font stacks, colors, typographic
styles and functions that I use the most. My defaults aren't necessarily
better, just different and more useful to me — and maybe to you too.

All credit is due to Eddie Machado and Bones. This is only a personal project
that I'm sharing in the hope that it might be useful to others.

Important Notes: 

- I use SASS/SCSS so the LESS files have not been touched at all.
- All style changes are in the .scss files

Where the Bones original styles or code has been altered, the original is 
commented out and changes are labeled with [added by JM].

Just a note about my personal workflow: I use Coda 2 (http://panic.com/coda/) 
as my main development app and CodeKit (http://incident57.com/codekit/) to
compile my Sass files.

Ok with that out of the way, back to our regularly scheduled program:
..................................................................

You may be thinking…

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA…WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

But before you freak out, let me take a few minutes to explain.

Bones now uses LESS or Sass by default. If you prefer
using regular CSS, then feel free to modify this theme how you like
and keep a copy as your own personal starting point.

DON'T DISMISS IT JUST YET THOUGH, USING LESS or Sass ISN'T AS
COMPLICATED AS YOU THINK.

It does take a few minutes to wrap your head around, but it will all
be worth it. Need a quick intro? Here are a few quick reads:

http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/09/an-introduction-to-less-and-comparison-to-sass/

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you are going to be working with
LESS or Sass, that you work locally. Sass isn't readable by a browser
and using a LESS js file to parse it on live sites can make your site sluggish.

That being said, here are a few MUST HAVE TOOLS for working with a
pre-processor: (You really only need one of them)

CodeKit: (Highly Recommended)
http://incident57.com/codekit/

LESS App:
http://incident57.com/less/

Compass App: (Windows / Mac Users)
http://compass.handlino.com/

SimpLESS: (Windows Users)
http://wearekiss.com/simpless

WinLESS: (Windows Users)
http://winless.org/

These applications compile LESS or Sass into valid CSS. This
way you can keep your production files easy to read and your
CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the output to the
library/css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, once you download Bones it's up to you how to use it,
so go nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for
you. If LESS/Sass is still a bit confusing for you, then remove them
and customize this template as you see fit.

If you're frustrated with this new direction and don't like change,
take a few minutes and think about how much better a developer you 
can become by just TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at 
first but it WILL make you a better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS. Give
it a week, maybe two, and you will never go back.

Happy Developing!
